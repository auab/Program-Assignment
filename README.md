# Program-Assignment - Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
## Instructions gaven for project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.


## Repository files 
* Item A README.md file - giving the main idea of the project and the files on it included
* Item A Codebook.md file - a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data in program run_analylsis.R
* Item run_analysis.R - the R program that makes the data tidy
